## Title
A Na√Øve Analysis of HSM vs FSM State Design Patterns
## Abstract
UNLV Senior Design team conducted an analysis of hierarchical vs flat implementations of state machine design patterns.
The team used two patterns to compare:
1. An original hierarchical design pattern using a modified version of the state design pattern defined in the GOF.
2. A classic implementation of the unmodified state design pattern.
We found that the HSM implementation consumes more time and memory at runtime, but it is much easier to read and maintain because it preserves hierarchical structure in the generated code.
