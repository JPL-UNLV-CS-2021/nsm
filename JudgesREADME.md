# Instructions for judges
## _Must be run on a windows 10 Machine_
QSM is a state design pattern for embedded flight systems the modern era.

- No Recursion
- No templating
- No Dynamic Memory
- Runtime polymorphism
- Abstract + Concrete Inheritance
- Heirarchical representation in code

## Features

- Import a QM file and watch it magically convert to a running state machine.
- Run heirarchical state machines with a virtually unlimited nesting depth.
- Create events in a simulated environment to see how the machine fairs.
- Change any aspect to the original statemachine design, and have a new machine in one command.



## Tech

QSM uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Python](https://breakdance.github.io/breakdance/) - A powerful scripting language
- [CMAKE](https://breakdance.github.io/breakdance/) - The standard compiler management project for c++
- [XML](https://breakdance.github.io/breakdance/) - a markup language that is both human-readable and machine-readable
- [LXML](https://breakdance.github.io/breakdance/) - an open source parsing library
- [JSON](https://breakdance.github.io/breakdance/) - a lightweight data-interchange format

And of course QSM itself is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/JPL-UNLV-CS-2021/qsm)
 on GitHub.

## Installation for Auto Coder

QSM is a tool to be used in conjuction with other tools  by JPL engineers in a development environment.
As such to test it we must first spend time setting up a similiar environment..

1. Figure out what kind of architecture your operating system is currently running. 32 bit or 64 bit

3. Install CMAKE
- Go to https://cmake.org/download/
- Scroll to "Binary distributions:" (under "Source Distributions")
- If you have a 32 bit version of Windows 10, download "Windows i386 Installer"
- If you have a 64 bit version of Windows 10, download "Windows x64 Installer"
- Run the installer
	- Accept User Agreement
	- On the Install Options page
		- SELECT "Add CMake to the system PATH for all users"
		- Next
	- Choose your installation location. The default is fine.
	- Proceed to install!

4. Double check the installation
	- Select the Start button
	- Type "Command Prompt" and launch the command prompt
	- In the command prompt type "python"
	  There should be version 3.X.X.
	  Use quit() or Ctrl-Z plus Return to exit
	- In the command prompt type "cmake"
	  You should see a response other than "cmake not recogonized".

        If both of those work then we successfully have CMAKE and python installed.
        
5. Download the project.

- Go to https://github.com/JPL-UNLV-CS-2021/qsm
- Click "Code" and then "Download ZIP"
- Extract the ZIP file in your downloads folder

6. Go back to the commandline and run the following commands
	```sh 
    cd %USERPROFILE%\Downloads\qsm\qsm\src\autocoder
	py -m venv venv_autocoder
	venv_autocoder\Scripts\activate
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	```

7. Make sure you have a valid QM statechart in the "Downloads\qsm\qsm\autocoder\XML" directory. 
(We have supplied a sample statechart.)

8. Create a list of events with time dispatched  > in.txt  (We have supplied a sample input file.)

9. Run your machine by executing:
    ```sh
    main.py XML\<yourStateChart.qm> <yourInput.txt>
    ```
    Or run our sample with
    ```sh
    main.py XML\demoChart3.qm in.txt
    ```
